# CoreJava-OOPS-Abstraction
OOPs Abstraction code

Lets start with Abstraction concept of core Java OOPS .

Abstraction
Data abstraction is the property with the help of which only essential data are displayed to the user.
Lets take a real life example to understand it better

Consider a real-life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the accelerators will increase the speed of car or applying brakes will stop the car but he does not know about how on pressing the accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of accelerator, brakes etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.
